# Non-Functional Requirements for Task Management System

## 1. Performance
- The system shall respond to user actions (e.g., creating, updating, deleting tasks) within 2 seconds under normal load.
- The system shall support at least 100 concurrent users without significant degradation in response time.
- The system shall ensure that database queries for task retrieval and filtering are optimized for speed.

## 2. Security
- The system shall use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for all client-server communications.
- The system shall store user passwords using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
- The system shall implement input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- The system shall enforce authentication for all task management operations.
- The system shall implement session management with automatic expiration after inactivity.

## 3. Scalability
- The system architecture shall support horizontal scaling to handle increased user load.
- The system shall be designed to allow for easy addition of new features and modules.
- The database shall be able to handle growth in the number of users and tasks without performance loss.

## 4. Usability
- The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate for users of all technical backgrounds.
- The system shall provide clear feedback for user actions (e.g., success, error messages).
- The system shall be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- The system shall follow accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to support users with disabilities.
